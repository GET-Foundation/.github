# GET Foundation
GET Foundation is a international collaboration to build foundation models to understand transcription. 

It's initiated by Xi Fu in [Rabadan Lab, Program of Mathematical Genomics, Columbia University](https://www.rabadanlab.org) and Shentong Mo, in [Eric Xing Lab in CMU and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://xing.mbzuai.ac.ae).

Our first release, GET (general expression transformer) is a model that can predict gene expression using solely cell-type specific chromatin accessibility data.
